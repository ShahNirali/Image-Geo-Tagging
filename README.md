# Image Geo Tagging

With the advent of technology, there has been accumulation of millions of images. These images become useless unless they are tagged. This analytic is an approach towards tagging images using Geo coordinates which is found in metadata of an image.

This project is implemented with help of MapReduce programming model to make the process scalable to millions of images.
